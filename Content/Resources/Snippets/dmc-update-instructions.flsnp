                <p>The process of updating the Deployment Monitoring Console from version 7.0 or later to the latest version is similar to the installation process.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to  , download and copy the <code>datical-service-unix-8_1_317-master.sh</code> file to your existing DMC server.</li>
                    <li>Run the installer with the following command and enter your existing OS user as the admin user and admin group:</li>
                    <pre>/home/datical&gt; sudo bash /datical-service-unix-8_1_317-master.sh</pre>
                    <li>Enter the directory of the previous DMC installation when prompted for an install location.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The installer will update your installation and restart affected DMC services. You can begin using the new version of the DMC immediately.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you have manually changed the java version used by DMC, you will need to restore DMCâ€™s default version of Java (11.0.8) before any time that you upgrade DMC. Move or copy Java 11.0.8 from the /opt/datical/old_jre directory back to the /opt/datical/jre directory prior to starting your DMC upgrade. DMC expects Java version 11.0.8 to be in the /opt/datical/jre directory for the DMC upgrade process to be successful. After your DMC upgrade is complete, you can change to a different 11.x java version again. For more information, see How to Change the Java version for DMC. This link is especially important if you are using v7.18 or later.</p>
