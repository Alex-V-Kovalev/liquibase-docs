        <p>Produces a <b>summary list</b> or a <b>verbose list</b> of any changesets skipped and why they were skipped. <b>Default: <code>false</code></b></p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">There can be multiple reasons listed. Simultaneously, only one reason may display in the summary. This indicates that Liquibase halted trying to deploy this changeset for this reason, although additional reasons might also exist. If Liquibase cannot resolve that halting reason, the changeset is not evaluated for other possible reasons that are not currently displayed.</p>
