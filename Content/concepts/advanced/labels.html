        <h1 id="labels">Labels</h1>
        <p>Labels in <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> are tags you can add to <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> to control which will be executed in any particular migration run.</p>
        <p>Labels were added in <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> 3.3 to work like contexts, but “backwards” in who can specify logical expressions. In your <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> you can only specify a simple list of “labels” that apply to the <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /> but at runtime you can write a complex expression to chose the labels you want to execute. This allows you to specify a <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /> with labels=”qa, acme_inc” and then at runtime use expressions such as --labels="!acme_inc" or --labels="pro or (free and beta)".</p>
        <p>Labels work best when you can simply enumerate/describe what a <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /> is for, but the deployment time environment is complex to describe. An example of when labels would work well is when you can describe <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> as for a particular feature or version such as “1.0” and/or “shopping_cart” but the decision on which features and/or versions needs to run is complex and chosen at deployment time. Labels in this case would allow you to run with --labels="1.0 or (1.1 and shopping_cart)" to deploy the 1.0 <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> and only the 1.1. features related to the shopping cart to one database and --labels="1.0 or (1.1 and !shopping_cart)" to another database.</p>
