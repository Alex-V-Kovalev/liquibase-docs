        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Quality Checks</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> quality checks allow you to run checks against <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> and SQL scripts by flagging conditions and configurations you need. Using the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> quality checks functionality, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Better secure your database by getting immediate notice that user and role privileges are being modified.</li>
            <li>Prevent data loss and corruption.</li>
            <li>Enforce internal standards and best practices to ensure that only high-quality, compliant changes are being deployed to your databases.</li>
            <li>Quickly, consistently, and easily validate your changes from the local development environments.</li>
            <li>Integrate the check capability into automated workflows to provide quality gates for database changes in automation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The initial capabilities are available for the following platforms: Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> quality checks include static and dynamic checks, the <code>checks</code> command with subcommands, and the checks settings file that includes defined configurations and parameters. All checks work in the command line, which is interactive and allows the configuration of dynamic checks.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you are a <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Community user, the execution is limited to 5 checks.</p>
