        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Node Package Manager</p>
        <p>The NPM installation method was developed with TypeScript and JavaScript engineers in mind. Luckily, a lot of popular Text Editors are improving their IntelliSense featuresets.</p>
        <p>With the new package you will get:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> command documentation right at your fingertips</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> command Parameter documentation</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> CLI Command API Parity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Library and CLI</h3>
        <p>In order to keep the DX as smooth as possible without deprecating the project that inspired the re-write, we've provided both an NPM package and a CLI tool. We did this by transpiling both an ES Module and a Common JS module in the dist code. The Node CLI of this package can be used with node-liquibase.</p>
        <p>However, when importing the modules to use them in a JavaScript or TypeScript file, be sure to import from the correct module name: liquibase. We are forced to keep this package name for now due to dependent projects.</p>
        <h3>Liquibase CLI Command API Parity</h3>
        <p>We were careful to ensure that all 'top level' Liquibase commands are implemented in this package. No more magic strings!</p>
        <p>Here's a complete listing of commands that have been implemented.</p>
        <h3>Liquibase CLI Peer Dependency (Optional)</h3>
        <h2>No Magic Strings!</h2>
        <p>Magic strings, while functional, are error prone. Instead of passing a string of the command and parameters to Liquibase, we've replicated the top level Liquibase CLI API within this package.</p>
        <p>Our aim is to provide a more stable and guided API for new Liquibase users operating in a Node context.</p>
        <p>This means no more of this:</p><pre>liquibase.run('status');</pre>
        <p>and more of this:</p><pre>liquibase.status();</pre>
