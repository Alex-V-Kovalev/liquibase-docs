        <p>When you use Data Pump for backup and restore in packaging, the location of the directory object must be visible from all instances and all processes in the cluster.&#160;The object is named <span class="inline-comment-marker">DATICAL_DATAPUMP_DIR</span> by default, but you can use a different name.</p>
        <p>A typical implementation uses a shared file system or drive for the location of the directory.</p>
        <p>Take care that all instances access the <em>same physical directory</em>. That directory must be the single point for backup and restore operations.</p>
