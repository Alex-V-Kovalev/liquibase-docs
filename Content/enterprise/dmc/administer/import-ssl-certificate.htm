        <h1>Import a SSL Certificate to <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" /></h1>
        <p>A&#160;self-signed certificate is established during installation. Typically a warning regarding this certificate appears upon opening <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" />. To complete the requirements for SSL (and eliminate the warning), you need to create and load your own SSL certificate. It must be signed by a root authority that is trusted by your network.</p>
        <h2>Load the SSL Certificate into DMC</h2>
        <p>Java's keytool CLI,  which ships with DMC, can  manage a keystore (database) of cryptographic keys, X.509 certificate chains, and trusted certificates.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy converted certificate and private key (domain.p12) to DATICAL_HOME/data/datical-service on DMC server.</li>
            <li>Run <pre>datical-control service stop all</pre> </li>
            <li>Delete a certificate that came with DMC:
            <pre>DATICAL_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -delete -alias datical -keystore keystore.p12</pre></li>
            <li>Import the PKCS 12 certificate by executing the following command:
            <pre>DATICAL_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass [password] -destkeystore DATICAL_HOME/data/datical-service/keystore.p12 -srckeystore DATICAL_HOME/data/datical-service /domain.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12</pre></li>
            <li>Run<pre>datical-control service start all.</pre></li>
            <p>In the end, the keystore.p12 file in DATICAL_HOME/data/datical-service/ needs to to have the signed public key, private key, and certificate chain included in it under the alias "datical" with a password of “datical”. It is usually best to make a backup of the original file before working with it.</p>

                <p>The process to generate a certificate varies based on your network setup, tools you use, and trusted authorities. Consult your system administrator or security administrator for the process used at your site.</p>
                <p>The following example is for illustration only.</p>
                <p>Create both the private key and CSR in a separate folder:</p>
                <p>mkdir ~/certs &amp;&amp; cd ~/certs</p>
                <p>openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr</p>
                <h2>Create a CA-Signed Certificate With Our Own CA</h2>
                <p>We can be our own certificate authority (CA) by creating a self-signed root CA certificate, and then installing it as a trusted certificate in the local browser.</p>
                <p>Create a private key (ca.key) and a self-signed root CA certificate (ca.crt) from the command line:</p>
                <p>mkdir ~/ca &amp;&amp; cd ~/ca</p>
                <p>openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 3654 -out ca.crt</p>
                <h2>
      Sign Our CSR With Root CA
                </h2>
                <p>Then sign our CSR (domain.csr) with the root CA certificate and its private key:</p>
                <p>openssl x509 -req -in ~/certs/domain.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out domain.crt -days 365</p>
                <p>As a result, the CA-signed certificate will be in the domain.crt file.<br /></p>
                <h2>
       Convert the signed certificate and private key to PKCS 12
                </h2>
                <p>You can't directly import private key information to a keystore using keytool. Instead, you must convert the certificate and private key into a PKCS 12 (.p12) file, and then you can import the PKCS 12 file into DMC keystore.</p>
                <p>Execute the command:</p>
                <p>openssl pkcs12 -export -in domain.crt -inkey ~/certs/domain.key -name [hostname] -out domain.p12</p>
                <h2>Useful commands that may help during the process</h2>
                <p>Move an existing keystore entry from the specified alias to datical alias:</p>
                <p>DATICAL_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -changealias -alias [oldalias] -destalias datical -keystore keystore.p12</p>
                <p>Changes the password used to protect the integrity of the keystore contents to datical</p>
                <p>DATICAL_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -storepasswd -keystore keystore.p12</p>
                <p>Regenerate the DMC HTTPS keys:</p>
                <p>datical-control https regenerate-keys</p>
