        <h1>How To: Prepare for a Liquibase Enterprise Upgrade</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/images/.ver_icon_size_enterprise.flsnp" />
        <p>Before beginning an upgrade, you should complete the following tasks to ensure that the process goes smoothly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Determine the target version for the upgrade.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The recommended practice is to upgrade to the latest version available.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Check the <a class="external-link" href="https://dmc.datical.com/release-notes/release-notes-home.htm" rel="nofollow">DMC Compatibility Matrix</a> to make sure that your version of Liquibase Enterprise will work with your version of DMC. In most cases you will need to upgrade both Liquibase Enterprise and DMC.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Download the software from</strong><a class="external-link" href="http://software.datical.com" rel="nofollow"><strong>software.datical.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instructions for downloading the software can be found here:  
						Downloading the <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> Installer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Locate your Liquibase Enterprise license file.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>You will need to reinstall the license file as part of the upgrade process.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Identify all servers and laptops where Liquibase Enterprise and DMC are installed.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>All servers must be upgraded at the same time. Running multiple versions of Liquibase Enterprise on the same project is not supported.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Verify that you can login to the servers where Liquibase Enterprise and DMC are installed.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>For Liquibase Enterprise, you must be able to login as the owner of the software.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>For DMC you will need <strong>sudo access</strong> to perform the upgrade.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Schedule downtime for your CI/CD pipeline.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>CI/CD jobs should not be running while the upgrade is in progress.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Review the documentation to make sure that you are familiar with the upgrade steps.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Liquibase Enterprise upgrades are performed by installing the new version of the software in a different location.</p>
