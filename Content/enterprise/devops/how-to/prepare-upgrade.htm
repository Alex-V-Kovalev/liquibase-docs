        <h1>How To: Prepare for a Liquibase Enterprise Upgrade</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <p>Before beginning an upgrade, you should complete the following tasks to ensure that the process goes smoothly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Determine the target version for the upgrade.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The recommended practice is to upgrade to the latest version available.</li>
                    <li>Check the <a class="external-link" href="https://dmc.datical.com/release-notes/release-notes-home.htm" rel="nofollow">DMC Compatibility Matrix</a> to make sure that your version of Liquibase Enterprise will work with your version of DMC. In most cases you will need to upgrade both Liquibase Enterprise and DMC.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Download the software from</strong><a class="external-link" href="http://download.liquibase.com" rel="nofollow"><strong>download.liquibase.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instructions for downloading the software can be found here:  
						Downloading the <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> Installer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Locate your Liquibase Enterprise license file.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need to reinstall the license file as part of the upgrade process.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Identify all servers and laptops where Liquibase Enterprise and DMC are installed.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>All servers must be upgraded at the same time. Running multiple versions of Liquibase Enterprise on the same project is not supported.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Verify that you can login to the servers where Liquibase Enterprise and DMC are installed.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>For Liquibase Enterprise, you must be able to login as the owner of the software.</li>
                    <li>For DMC you will need <strong>sudo access</strong> to perform the upgrade.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Schedule downtime for your CI/CD pipeline.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>CI/CD jobs should not be running while the upgrade is in progress.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Review the documentation to make sure that you are familiar with the upgrade steps.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Liquibase Enterprise upgrades are performed by installing the new version of the software in a different location.<ul><li><a href="../install/install-windows/gui-install-windows-systems.htm">Installing <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> on Windows Systems</a></li><li>Installing <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> on Linux Systems</li></ul></li>
                    <li>DMC upgrades are performed by running the new installer and providing the location where the current version of DMC is installed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
