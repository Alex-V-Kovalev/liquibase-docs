        <h1 class="Heading1">Multi-Schema Project Database Accounts, Roles and Permissions</h1>
        <p>Two datical database accounts are required for multi-schema projects.&#160; These accounts are referred to as DATICAL_USER and DATICAL_TRACKING.&#160; At runtime, <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> will connect to the database as the DATICAL_USER to process and deploy code.&#160; The DATICAL_TRACKING schema owns the DATABASECHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK tables used to track and manage database changes.&#160; The database change log tables are created in the default tablespace assigned to the DATICAL_TRACKING account.&#160; The database account names must be the same across all databases in the pipeline.&#160; The DATICAL_USER and DATICAL_TRACKING accounts should not be one of the managed schemas in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Database permissions for <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> are managed through Roles.&#160; Three <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> Roles are needed:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1">DATICAL_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project.&#160; Grants permissions to deploy objects to the managed schemas.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1">DATICAL_PACKAGER_ROLE - Required only on the REF database in the project.&#160; Grants additional permissions required to execute <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> packaging operations.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1">DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project.&#160; Grants permissions to manage the database change log.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must grant any user-defined roles that are granted to any managed schema to the SYSTEM user WITH ADMIN OPTION. Otherwise, <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> will not be able to successfully restore these roles during the packaging operation and packager will fail.</p>
