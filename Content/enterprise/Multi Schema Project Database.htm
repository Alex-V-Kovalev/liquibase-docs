        <h1>Multi-Schema Project Database Accounts, Roles and Permissions</h1>
        <p>Two datical database accounts are required for multi-schema projects. These accounts are referred to as DATICAL_USER and DATICAL_TRACKING. At runtime, <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> will connect to the database as the DATICAL_USER to process and deploy code. The DATICAL_TRACKING schema owns the DATABASECHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK tables used to track and manage database changes. The database change log tables are created in the default tablespace assigned to the DATICAL_TRACKING account. The database account names must be the same across all databases in the pipeline. The DATICAL_USER and DATICAL_TRACKING accounts should not be one of the managed schemas in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Database permissions for <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> are managed through Roles. Three <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> Roles are needed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>DATICAL_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project. Grants permissions to deploy objects to the managed schemas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>DATICAL_PACKAGER_ROLE - Required only on the REF database in the project. Grants additional permissions required to execute <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> packaging operations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project. Grants permissions to manage the database change log.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must grant any user-defined roles that are granted to any managed schema to the SYSTEM user WITH ADMIN OPTION. Otherwise, <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> will not be able to successfully restore these roles during the packaging operation and packager will fail.</p>
