        <h1>Configuring Datical Projects for DMCDB Use</h1>
        <p>The Datical DB client would configure objects for the Audit Database (predecessor to the DMCDB) in releases of Datical DB prior to 7.0. This has changed with the switch to the DMCDB in versions 7.0 and later.&#160;<span class="Strong">You should not configure Datical DB projects to use a DMCDB until the DMC is fully installed and operational.</span> If projects are configured to use the DMCDB prior to the complete installation of the DMC, the DMC installation may encounter issues.</p>
        <p>For more information on configuring Datical projects to report to a DMCDB refer to the DMC documentation for <a href="https://dmc.datical.com/configure/database-config/register-project-dmc.htm">Registering with the DMCDB</a></p>
