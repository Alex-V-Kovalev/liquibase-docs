        <h1>Packaging: Using EZCONNECT with SQLPLUS for Deployment Packager</h1> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/images/.ver_icon_size_enterprise.flsnp" /><p>When you are packaging files in the sqlplus directory, Deployment Packager&#160;runs SQLPLUS to load SQL Scripts into the database for packaging purposes.</p><p><MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> requires that EZCONNECT be configured in the <code>sqlnet.ora</code> file before it can successfully connect using SQLPLUS.</p><p><code>NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH=(TNSNAMES,EZCONNECT)
</code></p><p>Also note, there can be timing difference for connections on the laptops when the <code>EZCONNECT</code> value is placed in different orders in the <code>sqlnet.ora</code> file. If you normally rely on <code>tnsnames</code> to resolve your connections and you put the <code>EZCONNECT</code> before these values, you will see longer wait times for your connections. It appears to be going through each of the connection protocols before it finds the proper method, which succeeds.</p></body>
