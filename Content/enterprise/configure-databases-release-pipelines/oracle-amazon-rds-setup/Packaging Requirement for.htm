        <h1>Packaging Requirement for Exclusive Connection</h1>
        <p>Packaging requires that no other schema-owner users are connected to the database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Deployment Packager checks for connections to the REF database at the beginning of a packaging operation. Packaging stops and reports an error if there are other active connections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>During packaging, if a schema-owner user attempts to connect to the database, packager warns and may stop.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deployment packager drops schema during packaging. If it is running as a schema-owner user, other schema-owner users prevent it from dropping schema as needed.</p>
