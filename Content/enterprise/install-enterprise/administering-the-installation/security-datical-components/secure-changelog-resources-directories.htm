        <h1>Securing the Datical Changelog and Resources Directories</h1>
        <p>These directories contain the changes to be deployed. They are analogous to the SQL Scripts that DBAs have been responsible for deploying prior to using Datical DB. Datical DB requires that these directories are checked-in to source control and managed the same way application code is managed today.</p>
        <p>The same source code repository access controls that are in place for the application code need to be in place for the database code with the caveat that the Datical Project needs to reside in its own, separate repository.</p>
        <p>In the case where both the Packaging and Deployment processes are automated, access can be limited to the small set of individuals responsible for the initial setup and occasional management of a Datical Project as well as the deployment automation systems.</p>
        <p>There is no need to give Datical Project access to either the Developer or DBA teams for day-to-day operations.</p>
