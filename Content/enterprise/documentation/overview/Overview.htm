        <p class="NormalWeb">The Deployment Packager performs back ups of the REF database as part of standard operation. If packaging processes DDL files using the CONVERT workflow or fails for any reason, the database is restored from that backup. This allows future Deployment Packager jobs to start from a known good state when errors are encountered or contributed changes are rejected by the Deployment Packager.&#160; This page will inform you on configuration options for the backup and restore features of Deployment Packager.</p>
