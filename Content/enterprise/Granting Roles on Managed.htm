        <h1>Granting Roles on Managed Schema to the SYSTEM User</h1>
        <p>If you have user-defined roles assigned to the managed schema, you must grant those roles to SYSTEM user WITH ADMIN OPTION.&#160;</p>
        <p>During packaging, <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" />&#160;backs up user-defined roles for the managed schema along with the managed schema itself. The impdp operation works by having the SYSTEM user perform those backup and restore actions, so the SYSTEM user must be granted those roles.&#160;</p>
        <p>If the SYSTEM user is not granted those roles, the <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> packaging operation fails.&#160;</p>
