The package members are typically related to each other - perhaps HR rules, for instance. A package represents a namespace, which ideally is kept unique for a given grouping of rules. The package name itself is the namespace, and is not related to files or folders in any way.</p><p>It is possible to assemble rules from multiple rule sources, and have one top level package configuration that all the rules are kept under (when the rules are assembled). Although, it is not possible to merge into the same package resources declared under different names. A single Rulebase may, however, contain multiple packages built on it. A common structure is to have all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration (so that is it entirely self-contained).</p><p>The following railroad diagram shows all the components that may make up a package. Note that a package must have a namespace and be declared using standard Java conventions for package names; i.e., no spaces, unlike rule names which allow spaces. In terms of the order of elements, they can appear in any order in the rule file, with the exception of the package statement, which must be at the top of the file. In all cases, the semicolons are optional.</p><p><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Rule+Syntax+and+Construction/Rule Package.png" class="img_1" /></p><p>Notice that any rule attribute (as described the section Rule Attributes) may also be written at package level, superseding the attribute's default value. The modified default may still be replaced by an attribute setting within a rule.</p></body>
