        <h1>Rule Attributes</h1> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/images/.ver_icon_size_enterprise.flsnp" /><p>Rule attributes provide a declarative way to influence the behavior of the rule. Some are quite simple, while others are part of complex subsystems such as ruleflow. To get the most from Drools you should make sure you have a proper understanding of each attribute.<br /><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Rule+Syntax+and+Construction/Rule Attributes.png" class="img_4" /></p><h2>no-loop</h2><p>default value: false</p><p>type: Boolean</p><p>When a rule's consequence modifies a fact it may cause the rule to activate again, causing an infinite loop. Setting no-loop to true will skip the creation of another Activation for the rule with the current set of facts. <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> does not allow for the modification of facts within a rule.</p><h2>ruleflow-group</h2><p>default value: N/A</p><p>type: String</p><p>Ruleflow is a Drools feature that lets you exercise control over the firing of rules. Rules that are assembled by the same ruleflow-group identifier fire only when their group is active.</p><h2>lock-on-active</h2><p>default value: false</p><p>type: Boolean</p><p>Whenever a ruleflow-group becomes active or an agenda-group receives the focus, any rule within that group that has lock-on-active set to true will not be activated any more; irrespective of the origin of the update, the activation of a matching rule is discarded. This is a stronger version of no-loop, because the change could now be caused not only by the rule itself. It's ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you don't want any rule re-matching and firing again. Only when the ruleflow-group is no longer active or the agenda-group loses the focus those rules with lock-on-active set to true become eligible again for their activations to be placed onto the agenda.</p><h2>salience</h2><p>default value: 0</p><p>type: integer</p><p>Each rule has an integer salience attribute which defaults to zero and can be negative or positive. Salience is a form of priority where rules with higher salience values are given higher priority when ordered in the Activation queue.</p><p>Drools also supports dynamic salience where you can use an expression involving bound variables.</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">rule "Fire in rank order 1,2,.."</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">&#160; salience( -$rank )</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">when</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">&#160; Element( $rank : rank,... )</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">then</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">&#160; ...</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">end</p><h2>agenda-group</h2><p>default value: MAIN</p><p>type: String</p><p>Agenda groups allow the user to partition the Agenda providing more execution control. Only rules in the agenda group that has acquired the focus are allowed to fire.</p><h2>auto-focus</h2><p>default value: false</p><p>type: Boolean</p><p>When a rule is activated where the auto-focus value is true and the rule's agenda group does not have focus yet, then it is given focus, allowing the rule to potentially fire.</p><h2>activation-group</h2><p>default value: N/A</p><p>type: String</p><p>Rules that belong to the same activation-group, identified by this attribute's string value, will only fire exclusively. More precisely, the first rule in an activation-group to fire will cancel all pending activations of all rules in the group, i.e., stop them from firing.</p><p>Note: This used to be called Xor group, but technically it's not quite an Xor. You may still hear people mention Xor group; just swap that term in your mind with activation-group.</p><h2>dialect</h2><p>default value: as specified by the package type: String</p><p>possible values: "java" or "mvel"</p><p>The dialect species the language to be used for any code expressions in the LHS or the RHS code block. Currently two dialects are available, Java and MVEL. While the dialect can be specified at the package level, this attribute allows the package definition to be overridden for a rule.</p><h2>date-effective</h2><p>default value: N/A</p><p>type: String, containing a date and time definition</p><p>A rule can only activate if the current date and time is after date-effective attribute.</p><h2>date-expires</h2><p>default value: N/A</p><p>type: String, containing a date and time definition</p><p>A rule cannot activate if the current date and time is after the date-expires attribute.</p><h2>duration</h2><p>default value: no default value</p><p>type: long</p><p>The duration dictates that the rule will fire after a specified duration, if it is still true.</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">rule "my rule"</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">&#160; salience 42</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">&#160; agenda-group "number 1"</p><p class="HTMLPreformatted">when ...</p></body>
