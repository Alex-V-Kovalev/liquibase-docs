            <li>
                <p>Do not qualify objects with the <strong>database name</strong>. Datical takes care of that.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For a Single-Schema project, you do not have to qualify object names with the schema name. If not qualified, Datical uses the default schema for the user (dbo is the default).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For a Multi-Schema project, you must qualify object names with the schema name so they get deployed to the correct schema during packaging.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For a Multi-Database project, you must qualify object names with the schema name so they get deployed to the correct schema during packaging. You typically organized folders by database and schema. You may also use only the database folder level.
