        <h1>Examine Failed Operations caused by Rule Violations</h1>
        <p>If your deployment accidentally violates the rules applied to your database, you can generate a list of failed operations such as forecast, deploy, and packager that were caused by rule violations. This allows you to identify violations and resolve failures quickly. Learn more about Rules here.</p>
        <h2>Produce General statistics</h2>
        <p>Use the below queries to produce general statistics about executed operations.</p>
        <p class="tabcontent"><code>SELECT * from dprj_forecast;</code> <b>or</b> <code>SELECT * from dprj_deploy_packager</code></p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example: &lt;/b&gt;">Example output for <code>dprj_forecast;</code> :<br /><img src="../../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/create-projects/example1.png" /></p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example: &lt;/b&gt;">Example output for <code>dprj_deploy_packager;</code> :<br /><img src="../../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/create-projects/example2.png" /></p>
        <h2>Detailed Operations Statistics</h2>
        <p>Use this query to produce detailed statistics regarding rule violations and to which projects/operations they are related.</p><pre>SELECT o.project_name, o.action_type, r.LEVEL_NAME, r.PHASE, r.RULE_NAME, msg.MESSAGE<br />FROM RULE_RESPS as r<br />INNER JOIN RULE_RESP_MSGS as msg ON msg.FK_RULE_RESPS_ID = r.ID<br />INNER JOIN OPERATIONS as o ON r.FK_OPERATIONS_ID = o.ID<br />WHERE r.PARENT_TABLE = 'OPERATIONS' order by o.project_name;</pre>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">This query should be executed via the DMC database.</p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example: &lt;/b&gt;"><b>Example output:</b>
            <img src="../../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/create-projects/example3.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Detailed Change Impacts Statistics</h2>
        <p>Use this query to produce detailed statistics regarding the changes affected by rule violations and to which projects/operations they are related:</p><pre>SELECT ch.change_description, r.LEVEL_NAME, r.PHASE, r.RULE_NAME, msg.MESSAGE<br />FROM RULE_RESPS as r<br />INNER JOIN RULE_RESP_MSGS as msg ON msg.FK_RULE_RESPS_ID = r.ID<br />INNER JOIN CHANGE_IMPACTS as ch ON r.FK_CHANGE_IMPACTS_ID = ch.ID<br />WHERE r.PARENT_TABLE = 'CHANGE_IMPACTS';</pre>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example: &lt;/b&gt;">Example output:<img src="../../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/create-projects/example4.png" /></p>
