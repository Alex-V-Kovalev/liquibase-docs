        <h1 id="trimming-changelog-files">Trimming <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> files</h1>
        <p>Veteran <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> users often ask how to clear out a <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file that is unwieldy. This guide covers how to address this common occurrence.</p>
        <p>You add individual change sets to your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file to make changes to your database. Over time, those changes can build up to thousands of entries, many of which are now redundant or inefficient. These situations can look like a table  created and then deleted or, a table was created and then columns were added individually instead of creating a table with all the columns. </p>
        <h2>How to simplify the clutter</h2>
        <p>We strongly suggest you ask yourself if simplification is necessary. The <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> was built over a long period of time and it was ran and tested countless times. Editing the <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file introduces risk which has a cost of its own. Do the performance or file size concerns you have outweigh the risk of messing with a script that you know works? If they do, please proceed and find the scenario and solution that best fits your own circumstances and apply them accordingly.</p>
        <h3>Scenario and solution 1: Changelog File Size</h3>
        <p>Often the <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file is so large that your editor chokes on it, or there are too many merge conflicts. The best way to handle this is to simply break up your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file into multiple files. Instead of having a single <code>changelog.xml</code> file with everything in it, create a <code>main.changelog.xml</code> file which uses the tag to reference other <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> files.</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Z_Resources/Snippets/code/liquibase-xsd-xml-changelog-closed.flsnp" />
    &lt;include  file="com/example/news/news.changelog.xml"/&gt;  
    &lt;include  file="com/example/directory/directory.changelog.xml"/&gt;  
&lt;/databaseChangeLog&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">liquibase update</code> against the <code>main.changelog.xml</code> file, <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s in <code>com/example/news/news.changelog.xml</code> will run and then the <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s in <code>com/example/directory/directory.changelog.xml</code> will run. You can break up <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s in whatever manner works best for you. Some break them up by feature, some break them up by release. Find what works best for you.</p>
        <h3>Scenario and solution 2: Liquibase Update Time Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Other times, the problem is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">liquibase update</code> takes too long. <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> tries to be as efficient as possible when comparing the contents of the <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> table with the current <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file and even if there are thousands of already ran <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s, an <code>update</code> command should take just seconds to run. If you find that <code>update</code> takes longer than it should, watch the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> log to determine why. </p>
        <p>Perhaps there is an old <code>runAlways="true"</code> <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> that no longer needs to run or there are preconditions which are no longer needed. Running <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> with <code>--log-level=INFO</code> or even <code>--log-level=DEBUG</code> can give additional output which can help you determine which <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s are slow. Once you know what is slowing down your update, try to alter just those <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s rather than throwing out the whole <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> and starting from scratch. You will still want to retest your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> in-depth, but it is a far less risky change.</p>
        <h3>Scenario and solution 3: Surgically Alter Existing <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s</h3>
        <p>Some users find that <code class="highlighter-rouge">liquibase update</code> works well for incremental updates, but creating a database from scratch takes far too long.  Are you re-creating databases often enough that the risk of a change to the creation script makes sense? If you are,  look for problem <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s as described above.  Indexes often cause performance bottlenecks during database creation, so start with those. If you are creating and updating indexes frequently in your creation process, you may be able to combine those <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s into something more efficient.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When you need to surgically alter your existing <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s, remember how <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> works: each <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> has an <code>id</code>, an <code>author</code>, and a file path which together uniquely identifies it. If the <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> table has an entry for that <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> it will not run it. If it has an entry, it throws an error if the checksum for the <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> in the file doesn't match what was stored on the last run.</p>
        <h4>Alter a <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> manually by modification, merge, or removal</h4>
        <p><b>Modify:</b>
        </p>
        <p>How you modify your existing <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s will also depend on your environment and where in the <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> the problem <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s are. If you are modifying <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s that have been applied to all of your environments and are now only used on fresh database builds you can treat them differently than if they have been applied to some databases but not yet to others.</p>
        <p><b>Merge:</b>
        </p>
        <p>To merge or modify existing <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s you will be doing a combination of editing existing <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s, removing old <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s, and creating new ones.</p>
        <p><b>Remove:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Removing unneeded <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s is easy because <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> doesn't care about <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> rows with no corresponding <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s. Just delete out of date <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s and you are done. For example, if you have a <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> that creates the table <code>cart</code> and then another that drops it, just remove both <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s from the file. You must make sure, however, that there are no <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s between the create and the delete that make use of that table or they will fail on a fresh database build. That is an example of how you are introducing risk when changing your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> file.</p>
        <p><b>Example scenario:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Suppose instead you have a <code>cart</code> table that is created in one <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />, then a <code>promo_code</code> column is created in another and an <code>abandoned</code> flag is created in another.</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Z_Resources/Snippets/code/liquibase-xsd-xml-changelog-closed.flsnp" />
    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="1"&gt;  
        &lt;createTable  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="id"  type="int"/&gt;  
        &lt;/createTable&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  

    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="2"&gt;  
        &lt;addColumn  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="promo_code"  type="varchar(10)"/&gt;  
        &lt;/addColumn&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  

    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="3"&gt;  
        &lt;addColumn  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="abandoned"  type="boolean"/&gt;  
        &lt;/addColumn&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  

&lt;/databaseChangeLog&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Option 1:&#160;</p>
        <p>This will work well if all existing databases have the cart table with the <code>promo_code</code> and abandoned columns already added. </p>
        <p>- Combine everything into a new <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> using the existing <code>id="1"</code> .</p>
        <p>- Delete the other <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s.</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Z_Resources/Snippets/code/liquibase-xsd-xml-changelog-closed.flsnp" />
    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="1"&gt;  
        &lt;validCheckSum&gt;7:f24b25ba0fea451728ffbade634f791d&lt;/validCheckSum&gt;  
        &lt;createTable  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="id"  type="int"/&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="promo_code"  type="varchar(10)"/&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="abandoned"  type="boolean"/&gt;  
        &lt;/createTable&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  
&lt;/databaseChangeLog&gt;</code></pre>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Running <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> against existing databases just sees that <code>id="1"</code> already ran and does not commit any new script. </p>
        <p>Option 2: <br />Running <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> against a blank database will create the cart table with all the columns right away. It's important to note that the additional flag is required. If it was not added, existing databases will throw an error stating that <code>id="1"</code> has changed since it was run. </p>
        <p>- Simply apply the <code>validCheckSum</code> tag in the error message to notify <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> that you know it changed and the new value is valid.</p>
        <p>Option 4:<br />If you have some databases where the <code>promo_code</code> and/or abandoned columns have not yet been added, follow the below instructions:</p>
        <p>- Update the original <code>createTable</code> as before.</p>
        <p>- Use preconditions with <code>onFail="MARK_RAN"</code> to handle cases where the old <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s ran. </p>
        <p>- Do not add the columns again if the new <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s ran.</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Z_Resources/Snippets/code/liquibase-xsd-xml-changelog-closed.flsnp" />				  
    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="1"&gt;  
        &lt;validCheckSum&gt;7:f24b25ba0fea451728ffbade634f791d&lt;/validCheckSum&gt;  
        &lt;createTable  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="id"  type="int"/&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="promo_code"  type="varchar(10)"/&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="abandoned"  type="boolean"/&gt;  
        &lt;/createTable&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  

    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="2"&gt;  
        &lt;preConditions  onFail="MARK_RAN"&gt;  
            &lt;not&gt;&lt;columnExists  tableName="cart"  columnName="promo_code"/&gt;&lt;/not&gt;  
        &lt;/preConditions&gt;  
        &lt;addColumn  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="promo_code"  type="varchar(10)"/&gt;  
        &lt;/addColumn&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  

    &lt;changeSet  author="nvoxland"  id="3"&gt;  
        &lt;preConditions  onFail="MARK_RAN"&gt;  
            &lt;not&gt;&lt;columnExists  tableName="cart"  columnName="abandoned"/&gt;&lt;/not&gt;  
        &lt;/preConditions&gt;  
        &lt;addColumn  tableName="cart"&gt;  
            &lt;column  name="abandoned"  type="boolean"/&gt;  
        &lt;/addColumn&gt;  
    &lt;/changeSet&gt;  

&lt;/databaseChangeLog&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Option 5:<br />On existing databases that have all three <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s already ran, <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> will just continue on as before. For existing databases that have the old cart definition, it will see that the columns don't exist for <code>id="2"</code> and <code>id="3"</code> and execute as usual. For blank databases, it will create the table with the <code>promo_code</code> and abandoned columns and then in <code>id="2"</code> and <code>id="3"</code> it will see that they are already there and mark that they have ran without re-adding the columns. </p>
        <p><b>Preconditions</b>
        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Using preconditions will add a performance overhead to your update executions and are ignored in <code>update-sql</code> mode because <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> cannot know how applicable they are when <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s have not actually executed. For that reason it is best to avoid them if possible, but definitely use them when needed. </p>
        <p>Preconditions also add complexity to your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> which will require additional testing so keep that in mind when deciding whether to modify your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> logic. Sometimes it is easiest and safest to wait until all your databases have the columns and then modify the <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s to avoid the preconditions.</p>
        <p>The <code>cart</code>/<code>promo_code</code>/<code>abandoned</code> example shows some basic patterns you can use when modifying existing <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s. Similar patters can be used to optimize different types of bottleneck issues. Just remember when one <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> is changed, it can affect other <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" />s below which may need to be modified as well. This can easily spiral out of control so be mindful of what you are doing.</p>
        <p>If you end up finding that it will work best to completely restart your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />, see <MadCap:xref href="existing-project.html">Adding [%=General.Liquibase%] on an existing project</MadCap:xref> which describes how to add <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to an existing project (even if that project was previously managed by <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />).</p>
