        <h1>Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Database Limitations</h1>
        <p>"Commercial off-the-shelf" (COTS)&#160;software refers to pre-packaged software products that do not require extensive customization or development. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />&#160;<b>recommends against</b> using <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> tools to manipulate or manage the databases of pre-packaged COTS software.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><b>This does not apply to custom schemas, integrations, or analytics databases external to the COTS application</b>. It only applies to the database schema(s) managed by the COTS vendor's tooling.</p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Using <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to make deployments on a database schema managed by your COTS software can interfere with the vendor's upgrade procedures. As a result, your implementation of the COTS&#160;product may be unsupported by the vendor. This can have operational impacts on your business, as you may not be able to easily upgrade to newer versions or easily resolve problems with your COTS system.</p>
        <p>However, </p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>To determine if you are impacted by COTS&#160;limitations, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify whether you use a pre-packaged COTS software product</li>
            <li>database schemas are</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Be sure to understand how the customer/prospect intends to use Liquibase and the nature of the databases being targeted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask questions about the business functions and applications being supported.</li>
            <li>Ask if it they are packaged or home-grown.</li>
            <li>If it is a packaged product ask specifically if it is the "main" schema/schemas that are part of the vendor product or separate, custom schemas they (the customer/prospect) have created.</li>
            <li>If it is related to the "main" schema/schemas of the vendor product, discourage using Liquibase with that schema. Redirect them to vendor-provided tools and encourage Liquibase use for external, custom usage such as analytics, etc.</li>
        </ol>
