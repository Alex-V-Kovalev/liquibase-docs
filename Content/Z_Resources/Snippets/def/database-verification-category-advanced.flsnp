        <p><b>Advanced:</b> Databases verified to the Advanced level have been tested and validated  to deliver a minimum set of advanced capabilities around database inspection, support for long-running operations, as well as the Foundational level’s basic functionality of change management and change tracking aligned with the database.</p>
        <p>The advanced database inspection capabilities include the ability to generate <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />s in at least one format and the support of at least two additional state-based commands (snapshots, diffs, etc). In addition, the maintainer has established contact with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> and provided complete set-up and usage documentation along with clear and itemized reporting on supported and unsupported functionality for the database.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> customer support team provides how-to/usage support around verified capabilities for commercial customers using a database at the Advanced verification level. In cases where the maintainer is not <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, code-level support (bug fixes, enhancements, etc.) is provided by the maintainer with collaborative support from <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> for commercial customers.</p>
