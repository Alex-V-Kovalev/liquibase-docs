        <p><b>Foundational:</b> Databases verified to the Foundational level have been tested and validated to support the basic functionality of change management and change tracking aligned with the database. Additional advanced capabilities may be implemented but not yet to the level required to reach the Advanced verification level. In addition, the maintainer has established contact with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> and provided complete set-up and usage documentation.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> customer support team provides how-to/usage support around verified capabilities for commercial customers using a database at the Foundational verification level. In cases where the maintainer is not <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, code-level support (bug fixes, enhancements, etc.) is provided by the maintainer with collaborative support from <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> for commercial customers.</p>
