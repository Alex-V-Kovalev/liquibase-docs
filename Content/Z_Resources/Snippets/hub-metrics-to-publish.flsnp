        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;">The latest release of <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> introduces the <MadCap:xref href="../../tools-integrations/liquibase-hub/devops-metrics.htm">[%=General.Hub%] DevOps Metrics</MadCap:xref> functionality with four reports that provide the data to optimize your DevOps performance: Deployment Frequency, Change Migration Time, Change Failure Rate, Time to Fix Failing Changes.</p>
        <p><b>Change Migration Time</b>: the time to deploy changes to production for the last 30 days – and how it is trending from the previous 30 days. </p><b>Time to Fix Failing Changes</b>: the time needed to  recover from a failure  to successfully deploy to production during the last 30 days – and how it has been shifted from the preceding 30 days.
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">With the <b>Change Migration Time</b> and <b>Time to Fix Failing Changes</b> metrics, you can see how long it takes for the same <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /> to pass from the first target to the last target.</p></body>
