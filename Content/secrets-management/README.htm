The easiest way to install this extension is with `lpm` [liquibase package manager](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-package-manager).
```shell
lpm update
lpm add cyberarkpam-vault
```

## Setup
A [Liquibase Pro](https://www.liquibase.com/pricing/pro) License key is required.
### Required parameters
```
--vault-addr=PARAM
    URL for CyberArk PAM Vault Server
    (liquibase.vault.addr)
    (LIQUIBASE_VAULT_ADDR)
    [deprecated: --vaultAddr]

--vault-certfile=PARAM
    Certificate for CyberArk PAM Vault Server
    (liquibase.vault.certfile)
    (LIQUIBASE_VAULT_CERTFILE)
    [deprecated: --vaultCertfile]
```
### Adding RootCA certificate in your java security keystore
Example:
```
sudo keytool -importcert -alias CyberArkRoot -keystore /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -file RootCA.crt
```
If there is an error message showing PKIX exception you could have imported into the wrong cacerts file\
Run liquibase -version to see which jvm Liquibase is using

To debug the ssl connection, you can add this java environment variable to your command line
`-Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake`

## Using Secrets in Liquibase Properties
Any property in a Liquibase Properties file can be stored in CyberArk PAM Vault. In order for the vault plugin to know which properties should be populated from vault, use the pattern of `VAULT_TYPE,PATH_TO_NAME_IN_PAM,FIELD_TO_MAP`, see example below. 

## Example
```properties
username= cyberarkpam,UserName,username
password= cyberarkpam,Content,password
```
