        <h1>onMissingIncludeChangelog</h1>
        <p>An included <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> refers to a file that is tagged with the <MadCap:xref href="../change-types/include.html">include</MadCap:xref> tag within a separate <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />. When an included <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> cannot be found by Liquibase, it is considered missing. The <code>onMissingIncludeChangelog</code> is a parameter (or command argument) that controls how <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> behaves when a changelog specified in an <code>include</code> is missing. <br /><br />If it is set to <code>warn</code> and the Include <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> is not present, a warning message will appear. If it is set to fail and the Include <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> is not present, an error is thrown. The default configuration is <code>fail</code>. We recommend setting it to <code>warn</code>.</p>
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>If your Include <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> was removed by accident Liquibase will notify you right away so you know the exact cause of the error. With <code>onMissingIncludeChangelog</code> enabled, you will be able to quickly get to the bottom of why the file is missing and how to restore it.</p>
