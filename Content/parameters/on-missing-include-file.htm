        <h1>onMissingIncludeChangelog</h1>
        <p>The <code>onMissingIncludeChangelog</code> is a string parameter that looks for the include file in your database. If it is set to <code>warn</code> and the Include file is not present, a warning message will appear that states the Include file can't be found. If it is set to fail and the Include file is not present, an error is thrown. The default configuration is <code>fail</code>.</p>
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>If your Include file was removed by accident Liquibase will notify you right away so you know the exact cause of the error. With <code>onMissingIncludeChangelog</code> enabled, you will be able to quickly get to the bottom of why the file is missing and how to restore it.</p>
