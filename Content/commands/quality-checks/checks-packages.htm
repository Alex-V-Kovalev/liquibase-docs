        <h1>Quality Checks Packages</h1>
        <p>

        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> 4.25.0 checks packages are available. Checks-packages is a YAML&#160;file that allows you to create a list of multiple checks-settings files which can run in one command such as <code>checks run</code> or <code>checks show</code>. This allows different teams to own, control, update, and automatically synchronize their checks with their dependent teams. This means that different aspects of checks can be controlled by different teams. You also can centralize Quality Check resources. The check package file can be centralized as the main hub that has spokes reaching out to the Quality Check files needed for different jobs, pipelines, and teams. You may also reach local and remote locations with one command because each team can refer to the same files.</p>
        <h2>Implement Checks-packages</h2>
        <p><code>checks packages</code> only work with <code>checks run</code> and <code>checks show</code>. </p>
        <p>There is a column in the <code>checks show</code> table that displays the source check-settings file. There is also an extra display line to the console output for checks run to highlight the check-settings file which holds the enabled checks and other check run console output. Learn how to <MadCap:xref href="workflows/use-checks-settings-config-file.htm">Use the Checks Settings Configuration File</MadCap:xref> here.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that we dedupe at the file level, <b>not</b> the check level. So two EXACT paths will be deduped, but different files can have checks named the same, say “myLabelCheck,” and we wont try to dedupe that check itself.</p>

## These checks-settings-files listed in a package are processed sequentially
## during 'liquibase checks run' or 'liquibase checks show' commands
## which specify this file as the checks-settings-file property.
