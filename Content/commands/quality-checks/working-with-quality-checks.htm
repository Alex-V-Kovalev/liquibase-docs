        <h1>Working with Quality Checks</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> quality checks allow you to analyze your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i>, <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i>, and SQL for specific commands and patterns that must be reviewed more closely early in the development lifecycle. It can also be integrated into your build and deployment automation to prevent non-compliant changes from entering the pipeline.</p>
        <p>You can customize the types of checks that are executed to fit the needs of your organization. With <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> quality checks, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Better secure your database by getting immediate notice that user and role privileges are being modified.</li>
            <li>Prevent data loss and corruption.</li>
            <li>Enforce internal standards and best practices to ensure that only high-quality, compliant changes are added to your projects.</li>
            <li>Quickly, consistently, and easily validate your changes from the local development environments.</li>
            <li>Integrate checks into automated workflows to provide quality gates for database changes in automation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Quality checks have been tested for Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB, but should be compatible with any relational database supported by <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />.</p>
        <p>Quality checks include static and dynamic checks, the <code>checks</code> command with subcommands, and the checks settings file that includes defined configurations and parameters. All checks work in the command line, which is interactive and allows the configuration of dynamic checks.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><MadCap:variable name="General.LBCommunity" /> users are  limited to 5 checks per execution. <MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" /> users can run unlimited checks per execution.</p>
