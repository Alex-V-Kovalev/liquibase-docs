        <h1>Structured Logging</h1>
        <p>Structured Logging makes <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> operation data easily available for automated monitoring and analysis tools to read, query, and act upon in automated workflows. This feature significantly improves the way <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> logs its actions and events to make records machine-readable, easily-ingested, and queryable by industry standard observability and analysis tools.</p>
        <p>To enable Structured Logging, set the LIQUIBASE_LOG_FORMAT to JSON via the <MadCap:variable name="General.liquiPropFile" /> file, environment variable, or the CLI.</p>
