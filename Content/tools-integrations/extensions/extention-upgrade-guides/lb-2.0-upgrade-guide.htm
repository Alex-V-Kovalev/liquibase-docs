        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> 2.0 Extension Upgrade Guide</h1>
        <p>Liquibase 2.0 introduces several non-compatible changes that will require action to upgrade from 1.9 to 2.0. Please update this wiki page with additional issues or work-arounds you find. For a list of new features in 2.0, see the <a href="https://github.com/erikakalar/liquibase.github.com/blob/master/v2_features.html">2.0 features list.</a></p>
        <h2>Checksum Format Change</h2>
        <p>Liquibase stores checksums for each change executed in the DATABASECHANGELOG table. These checksums are used to alert the user to changeSets that have been changed after they were executed, and to handle runOnChange="true" changeSets.</p>
        <p>The way we compute these checksums changed in 2.0. The first time you update an existing database, Liquibase will detect the old format and upgrade the checksum values. During this first run, Liquibase will not be able to detect modified changeSets or runOnChange requirements. If you are concerned about this, you may want to run a known unchanged changelog against the database with 2.0 before updating your new changelog.</p>
