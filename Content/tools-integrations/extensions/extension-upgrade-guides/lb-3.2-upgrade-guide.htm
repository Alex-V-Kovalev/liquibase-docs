        <h2>Updates to UTF-8 handling</h2>
        <p>Use of UTF-8 has been made more consistent. This may affect some stored checksums if using non-ASCII characters. If you run into checksum issues, you can use the <code>&lt;validCheckSum&gt;</code> tag to mark both as valid or set the md5sum column to null in your databases to have it updated.</p>
        <h2>New <code>liquibase.change.Change.checkStatus(Database)</code> method</h2>
        <p>There is a new <code>checkStatus(Database)</code> method added to the <code>Change</code> interface which is used to validate that the change successfully ran against the given database. The <code>AbstractChange</code> base class implements it to throw a "not implemented" exception which will be fine in most cases currently, but will be used in future releases.</p>
        <h2>Major changes to ResourceAccessor</h2>
        <p>The <code>liquibase.resource.ResourceAccessor</code> interface was changed to better encapsulate file access logic. See the new <code>javadoc</code> for more information</p>
        <h2>Parsing and serialization logic</h2>
        <p>The XML, YAML, and JSON ChangeLogParsers were changed along with many other serializable classes. A new <code>liquibase.parser.core.ParsedNode</code> class was added as an intermediary format.</p>
