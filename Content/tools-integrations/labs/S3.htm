        <h1>S3</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />can integrate the use of Amazon S3 to store and retrieve data from anywhere. Extending <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />to use remote file locations addresses the DevOps persona by enabling secure, centralized file management. <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />files include changelogs, snapshots, SQL files, liquibase.properties files, native executor configuration files, checks settings configuration files and flow files.</p>
        <p>Remote file location access allows you to build a reusable repository of <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />files. It also removes the need for all developers to have local copies of Liquibase files, thus preventing drift.</p>
        <h2>Use S3 Files Locally</h2>
        <p>- In what scenario do users need to work locally?&#160;(Is this something that we need to answer or will users already know they should work locally?)</p>
        <p>Files must be in the same directory structure as they are on S3 </p>
        <h3>File Path Rules:</h3>
        <p>You must specify the full path of any file located in your S3 bucket for <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to find it successfully.</p>
        <p>Flow files can be called on from s3 buckets as well.</p>
        <p>Full Path Example:</p>
        <p><code>globalVariables:<br></br>DEFAULTSFILE:&#160;"s3://mys3bucket/<MadCap:variable name="General.liquiPropFile"></MadCap:variable></code>
