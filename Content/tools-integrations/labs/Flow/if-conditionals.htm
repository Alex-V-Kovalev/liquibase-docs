        <p>if:&#160;conditionals allow you to set specific blocks of code to run or not run depending on your flow file functionality needs.</p>
        <h2>If:&#160;conditionals code format</h2>
        <p>If conditionals exist within their own block of code within a Stage in a Flow file. A few formatting rules to note are:</p>
        <p>- The entire conditional must be encompassed by "quotes".</p>
        <p>- Variables must begin with $ and be encompassed by {curly braces} .</p>
        <p>All together this will appear as:</p>
        <p><code>if:&#160;"${LIQUIBASE_ACTIVE_TARGET} == dev"</code>
        </p>
        <p>- Any defined <a href="variables.htm">variable</a> can be used as a conditional. This includes but is not limited to environment variables and global variables.</p>
        <h2>Implement <code>if: conditionals</code></h2>
        <p>Values within if conditionals are called on in the format below. If the conditional value is set to true, it will run the command. If the conditional value is set to false, it will not run the command.</p>

        <p>When <code>liquibase flow</code> runs,  messages will appear in the CLI after the flow file executes each section. Notice in the sample message below it says <code>Executing 'liquibase' checks run</code> because the environment variable above is set to true. You will also notice the message <code>Skipping action:&#160;'liquibase' updatesql because condition 'dev != dev' evaluated to false.'</code> This is the best location to find why if:&#160;conditionals did or did not run successfully. If you expected a conditional to run successfully and it did not, you are better equipped to adjust the flow file accordingly. </p>
