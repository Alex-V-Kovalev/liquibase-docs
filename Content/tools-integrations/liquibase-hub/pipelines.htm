        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> Pipelines </h1>
        <p>A Pipeline is a way to collect, sort, and view the status of <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> deployed to Targets in a <a href="https://hub.liquibase.com/"><MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /></a> Project. It is a way to monitor the flow of your database schema changes across your databases.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Targets represent databases and include your JDBC URL, the operations performed on the database, and the status of the changes deployed to the database. Learn more about Targets in <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</p>
        <p>Pipelines are constructed from Targets as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Target can be in any Pipeline only once.</li>
            <li>You can add the same target to multiple pipelines in the same project.</li>
            <li>Pipelines do not cross Projects, which means all the Targets you want to track in a Pipeline must be in the same Project.</li>
            <li>By default, <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> orders Pipeline Targets in the sequence they were added. You can reorder these by dragging them into a different sequence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Pipeline is owned by an Organization Admin, like all other Organization resources, regardless of who created it. Only the Organization Admin can deactivate, restore, or delete a Pipeline. Any Organization member can create and edit their Pipeline.</p>
        <h2>Managing a Pipeline</h2>
        <p>You can see the following information when using <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> pipelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The list of all Pipelines in your project.</li>
            <li>The name and description of the Pipeline.</li>
            <li>	The number of Targets and their overview.</li>
            <li>The date and time when the Target was created and who created it.</li>
            <li>The last operation with the count of passing and failed <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> and its date and time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Creating a Pipeline</h2>
        <p>If your Project has targets, you can create a Pipeline with these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>	Go to <b>Projects</b>, select a Project, select the <b>Pipelines</b> tab, and <b>+ Create pipeline</b>.</li>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_1.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 182px;" />
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Enter your Pipeline name and description, and then select <b>Add Target</b>.</li>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_2.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 240px;" />
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
Pick the Target from the dropdown list and select <b>Add</b>.
            </li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The list represents a collection of all Targets in your Project which are not in your Pipeline. After you add the Target to this Pipeline, it is no longer on the list.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_3.png" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: 192px;mc-thumbnail: hover;" />
            </p>
            <p>To add a new Target or change the name and description, you can find the needed Pipeline and select <b>Edit</b>.</p>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_4.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 192px;" />
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Select the <b>Create</b> <b>Pipeline</b> button.</li>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_5.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 240px;" />
        </ol>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Check your Pipeline for the Target.</li>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_6.png" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: 200px;mc-thumbnail: hover;" />
        </ol>
        <h2>Sorting Targets in Your Pipeline</h2>
        <p>By default, <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> sorts targets in the order they are added to the Pipeline, starting from the first Target. If you have several Targets in your Pipeline, you can alter their order with drag-and-drop functionality.</p>
        <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/Sorting_connections.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 240px;" />
        <h2>Deactivating and Deleting a Pipeline</h2>
        <p>You must be an Organization Admin to deactivate or delete a Pipeline. Before deactivating or deleting a Pipeline, please take into consideration the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you deactivate a Pipeline, everyone in your Organization will only see it in a deactivated state from the Pipelines list and will not be able to click it for details. After being reactivated, a Pipeline will be available for detail viewing again.</li>
            <li>If you delete a Pipeline, <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> removes it from your Project for everyone. No data is lost as the Pipeline is a collected view of individual Targets, so no one can check the flow of changes across these Targets easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To delete or deactivate a pipeline, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <b>Projects</b>, choose the Project you need, and then select <b>Pipelines</b>.</li>
            <li>Choose the needed pipeline and select <b>Edit</b>.</li>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_4.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 192px;" />
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Select the <b>Delete</b> or <b>Deactivate</b> button to make the change.</li>
            <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/pipeline-targets/pipelines_targets_7.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 240px;" />
        </ol>
        <h2>Removing a Target in Your Pipeline</h2>
        <p>You can remove a Target from your Pipeline by selecting the <b>Remove</b> button under the <b>Edit Pipeline</b> view. You will only remove the Target from the Pipeline and will not affect any data or status of the Target.</p>
