        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> Organizations</h1>
        <p>Organizations exist to collect all the elements used in the <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> system. These include Projects, <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i> and their <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: italic;" /><i>s</i>, connections, and Operation reports, which are the data sent from <MadCap:variable name="General.LBCommunity" /> or <MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" /> when it performs various commands on a registered <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" style="font-style: italic;" />.</p>
        <p>Organizations also have one or more Admins, who can invite <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Hub users to become members. Members of an Organization can view and send Operations data to Projects within the Organization.</p>
        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>Any user who creates an Organization will be the initial Organization Admin, who is responsible for inviting other Hub users to become Organization members. When you join <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />, it auto-creates an Organization for you, and as its creator, you are its initial Admin.</p>
        <p>Any Organization Admin can make any Organization member an Admin. All Admins have the same administration rights, and there is no Organization Super-Admin.</p>
        <p>Any Organization member can create Projects in the Organization and has access to all Organization's Projects.</p>
        <p>If you are an administrator for the Organization and want to delete your account, you will need to remove yourself as an administrator for this Organization. However, be aware that the last Admin cannot leave the Organization, although they can make the Organization inactive, which has the outcome of blocking all access to the Organization's elements.</p>
        <p>An Organization Admin can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assign and revoke an Organization Admin role to others in the Organization</li>
            <li>Remove other Organization Admins or Organization members</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When you remove a member from an Organization, all roles for that user that are associated with the Organization are removed. All API keys of that user that are associated with the Organization are removed as well. Additionally, when you remove an admin role, their member role remains.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update Organization's name, shortName, description, and other meta properties</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Organization shortName doesn't support commas, spaces, underscores, periods, or other special characters except for hyphens ( - ) and must be lowercase and unique across all organizations. For example, datical1.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invite users to the Organization and manage invitations sent to users</li>
            <li>See the Organization name, id, date created, and creator</li>
            <li>See the Projects, Admins, and Users with access to the Organization</li>
            <li>See and set the status <code>active</code> or <code>inactive</code> of the Organization</li>
            <li>Manage the membership and access to projects in the Organization from Organization's detail page, Project's detail page, or User's detail page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An Organization member can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new Project and see the existing Projects of the Organization</li>
            <li>See the Organizations of which they are a member</li>
            <li>See other Organization members</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a user who doesn't yet belong to a specific Organization, you need to accept an invite sent by an Organization Admin to your email address.</p>
        <h2>Create an Organization</h2>
        <p>Any user can create an Organization with Projects and invite others by their email address.</p>
        <p>To create a new Organization, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Hub Home</b> button, go to <b>My Organizations</b>, and then select <b>My Organizations</b> on the left pane.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Create an Organization</b> on the right side of the <b>My Organizations</b> page.</li>
            <li>Fill in the information about Organization name, primary email contact, organization's friendly name, which will be used for creating a unique URL in <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />, and description.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Submit</b> to complete the process.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Alternatively, you can create a new Organization from a drop-down box in the upper-left corner.</p>

        </h2>
        <h2>Use an Organization</h2>
        <p>If you are an Organization Admin, you can manage the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Organization's profile, located in the <b>Hub Home</b> &gt; <b>Administration</b> tab</li>
            <li>Billing information</li>
            <li>Your API keys</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">You can also invite, manage, and grant members an Admin role.</p>
        <p>See all the operations from across your Organization and sort them by operation type, result, Project, <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" style="font-style: italic;" />, connection, and date. For this, go to <b>Hub Home</b> &gt; <b>Overview</b> &lt; <b>Operations</b>.</p>
        <p>As a member of multiple organizations, you can switch between organizations by selecting <b>My Organizations</b> and choosing the one you need.</p>
        <h2>Invite users to an Organization</h2>
        <p>You need to be an Organization Admin to invite a user to your regular Organization:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the <b>Hub Home</b> button, and then select <b>Members</b> on the left pane.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">You can also invite users by selecting the <b>Invitations</b> page.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/invite2.png" alt="" title="" />
            </p>
            <li>Select <b>Invite a new member</b> on the right side of the <b>Members</b> page.</li>
            <li>In the pop-up window, enter an email address of the user you want to invite and select <b>Submit</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As an Organization Admin, you can delete an open or expired invitation sent to a user. A default expiration time is seven days. To continue an expiration time, just resend the invitation.</p>
        <p>As an Organization Admin, you can see a list of invitations sent to users along with the status, date, and creator of that invitation. Pending invitations are available in a separate tab, which is located under <b>Organization Members</b> &gt; <b>Invitations</b>.</p>
        <h2>Accept the invitation to join an Organization</h2>
        <p>As a <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> user, you can easily accept an invitation to an Organization by entering a valid invitation code:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the <b>Hub Home</b> button, and then select <b>My Organizations</b> on the left pane.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Join an Organization</b> on the right side of the <b>My Organizations</b> page.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/core-usage/invite.png" alt="" title="" />
            </p>
            <li>Enter the invitation code that you received via email and then select <b>Submit</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If the user is not registered in <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />, they can still be invited via email and will be prompted to sign up for <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</p>
        <h2>Manage API keys for multiple Organizations</h2>
        <p>As an Organization member or Admin, you will have a specific API key which ties you to this Organization's Projects and other data. If you are in three Organizations, you will need to manage three API Keys.</p>
        <p>Ensure you are using the correct API Key in your defaults file or entering it as a CLI argument when you register a <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" style="font-style: italic;" /> to see and choose among the Projects of that Organization, and when you run commands that you want to report to <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</p>
        <h2>Next up:</h2>
