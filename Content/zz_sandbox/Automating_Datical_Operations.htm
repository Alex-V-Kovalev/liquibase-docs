        <h1>Automating Datical Operations</h1>
        <p>Although Datical operations can be performed manually, the best practice for DevOps environments is to run Datical operations from automation software.&#160;</p>
        <p>Typically a workflow in an automation solution includes steps that run Datical operations through the CLI.&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Status</li>
            <li>Forecast</li>
            <li>Deploy</li>
            <li>Rollback</li>
            <li>(Any Datical Command)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Packaging SQL Code into changesets is typically managed by automation in the SCM environment (a "hook" or "trigger" that runs the Deployment Package when changes are checked in).&#160;</p>
        <h2 id="AutomatingDaticalOperations-ConfiguringAutomationSolutionstoRunDaticalOperations">Configuring Automation Solutions to Run Datical Operations</h2>
        <p>An integration provides the mechanism (plug-in) for an automation solution to run Datical CLI commands.&#160;</p>
        <p>You typically need to do the following to set up automated Datical operations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the plug-in in your automation solution.</li>
            <li>Set global properties that store information about how to run the commands:<ul><li>Location of the hammer command</li><li>Location of Datical database drivers</li></ul></li>
            <li>Create steps in the automation solution to perform Datical operations. Each step runs one or more Datical Commands.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
