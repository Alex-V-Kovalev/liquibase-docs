                    <br />This notice is important for anyone upgrading from older Datical 4.x or 5.x versions to the newer Datical 2019.x or 6.x versions. For example, going from Datical 5.12 to Datical 6.9.  </p>

        <p>If you are using Datical Service (DMC), we strongly recommend the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Upgrade Datical Service to match the version of Datical DB.</strong> It’s important to avoid mismatches in versions as older versions of DMC are not currently guaranteed to work seamlessly with the 2019.2.2 Desktop Client and CLI. The minimum version of DMC that is compatible with DaticalDB 2019.2.2 or 6.x is Datical Service (DMC) 5.8<strong>.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The newest release of Datical Service/DMC is version 6.9:  <a href="Datical_v6_9___Release_Notes.htm" rel="nofollow">Datical v6.9 - Release Notes</a></p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you intend to upgrade your Datical DB Desktop Client to 2019.2.2 (or higher), please note the following:</p>
        <p><strong>It is not possible to follow the standard upgrade process to get to the 2019.2.2 (or higher) desktop client</strong>. You need to do the following:  </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Back up the workspace in your current installation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform a fresh install into a new install directory. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Restore the saved workspace to the new installation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You must follow this procedure to allow you to revert to a previous version. </p>
        <p>For a detailed procedure, see <a href="Required_Preparation_Installing_GUI_v2019x_v6x.htm" rel="nofollow">Required Preparation for Installing the GUI Client in v2019.2 and Later</a></p>
        <p><strong>This upgrade is not compatible with older versions of the Datical desktop client.</strong> Once your workspace has been updated to 2019.2.2, you can no longer open projects with older versions of the desktop GUI client. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Coordinate the upgrade of the desktop client so that all users switch over to the 2019.2.2 (or higher) client. Otherwise, any users relying on the older desktop client will not be able to open and interact with projects that have been opened in a 2019.2.2 (or higher) client.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you foresee needing to fall back to an older version of Datical DB, we strongly recommend that <em>keep a copy of the backed-up workspace</em>. See <a href="Required_Preparation_Installing_GUI_v2019x_v6x.htm" rel="nofollow">Required Preparation for Installing the GUI Client in v2019.2 and Later</a>. </p>
        <p><strong>Changes have been made to the update site and plugins.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The update site (<a class="external-link" href="http://update.datical.com/" rel="nofollow">http://update.datical.com/</a>) has been reorganized to avoid mistakes and confusion in adopting different source code plugins or performing updates. The new urls are <a class="external-link" href="http://update.datical.com/latest/thirdparty" rel="nofollow">http://update.datical.com/latest/thirdparty</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://update.datical.com/latest/gui" rel="nofollow">http://update.datical.com/latest/gui</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Git plugin is now built in to the 2019.2.2 (or higher) desktop client. You do not install it separately. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
