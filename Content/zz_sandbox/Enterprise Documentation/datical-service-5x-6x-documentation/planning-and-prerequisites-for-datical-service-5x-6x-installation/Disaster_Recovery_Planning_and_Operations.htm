        <p>Datical Service can be backed up. The system state that is backed up can be used to restore Datical Service in the event of an event that destroys the hosts that run Datical Service.&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run backups periodically</li>
            <li>Copy the backed-up data to an off-site repository</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the event of a disaster event, you can restore the backed-up data to new hosts running new installations of Datical Service.&#160;</p>
