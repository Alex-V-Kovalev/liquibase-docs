        <h1>Troubleshooting the Accelerator (deprecated)</h1>
        <p>
            <br class="atl-forced-newline" />
            <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">The accelerator/compression driver has been deprecated in version 7.16 and higher. It was previously available only with versions 7.15 and lower.</span>
        </p>
        <p>If the driver ran into any errors when loading, it would write the error messages out to the Datical GUI console window with versions 7.15 or lower. Please check the console for additional information that will help to resolve the problem.&#160; The following is a list of the most common issues that could occur when setting up this feature with versions 7.15 or lower:</p>
        <p>
            <br class="atl-forced-newline" />
            <em>Java not installed on the database</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install the JavaVM as documented in the above Verify &amp; Install Oracle Database JavaVM section.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Feature not licensed correctly</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install the Datical Accelerator for Oracle license</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>No Java permissions (but the JavaVM is installed)</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grant the missing permissions to the user account accessing the database.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Error installing the Stored Procedure (permissions or doesn't compile)</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grant the missing permissions to the user account accessing the database.</li>
            <li>If the stored procedure doesn't compile, contact our Technical Support team for assistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>DeployCommand failure due to cannot find database driver</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>With versions 7.16 or higher, if the accelerator is enabled, you may see these errors.&#160; That is because the accelerator was deprecated and the driver is no longer included with versions 7.16 or higher.</li>
        </ul>
