        <p>The Datical Accelerator for Oracle improved performance in some environments by compressing the results data produced by an Oracle database before sending them to Datical DB. Using the accelerator involved a tradeoff between host resource usage and network usage.&#160; The accelerator/compression driver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Required additional CPU and memory resources on the database host (for compressing) and the Datical DB host (for uncompressing).</li>
            <li>Reduced time and network resources for sending the results data over the wire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The accelerator was helpful in cases where the network connection is slow, such as when lower-speed networks are used or when the Oracle database and Datical DB application are far apart geographically. The performance depended on the results data generated. In some environments, performance could be improved by a factor of 10X or more.</p>
        <p>In versions 7.15 or lower, you could install the following components which might improve performance in some environments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Datical DB Driver for Oracle</li>
            <li>Datical Accelerator, a Java class loaded into the Oracle JavaVM</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the Datical Accelerator was enabled for a project or database, all Datical commands in that context used it.</p>
