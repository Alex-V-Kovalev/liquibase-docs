How to make docs changes
====================================================================

1. Navigate to the file you want to change in the GitHub web UI.
    1. Start with the Content folder. The other folders are for styling, templates, and other site information.
    2. The file system hierarchy in the https://github.com/Datical/liquibase-docs.git repository mirrors the URL structure in the https://docs.liquibase.com website.
        - For the file residing in **liquibase-docs/Content/commands/pro/rollbackonechangeset.html** repository,
        - the corresponding url would be: **https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/pro/rollbackonechangeset.html**
2. Click **Edit** to make the changes you need in the GitHub web UI
3. Write a detailed description so the docs team knows what you did and why.
4. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**
5. The docs team will review your PR, merge it to master, and publish the changes.

Thank you for your submission!
