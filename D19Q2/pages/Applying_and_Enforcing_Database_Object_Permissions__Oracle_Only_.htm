        <h1>Applying and Enforcing Database Object Permissions (Oracle Only)</h1>
        <p>Datical DB provides an Oracle only feature that gives DBAs the ability to specify object-level permission schemes. These schemes are automatically applied and enforced on every deployment. This ensures that object permissions are consistent and correct across all databases.<br />Define permission schemes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Specify permission schemes for one or more roles or schemas</li>
            <li>Specify a permission scheme based on types of objects or specific objects – for instance, "All new tables created should have READ/WRITE access for the application user"</li>
            <li>Specify exceptions to an object's permission schemes for edge cases where an individual table, view or other object should be handled differently</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deploy permission schemes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validate and update database object permissions every time you deploy to a database</li>
            <li>Revoke permissions that were applied outside of the standard deployment process if they conflict with your defined permission schemes, eliminating the threat of unauthorized access</li>
            <li>Report on all permission changes including any out-of-process permission changes that violate the defined permission schemes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <br />
