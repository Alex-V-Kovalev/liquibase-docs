                <p>Starting in Datical DB v5.5, this feature no longer requires a separate license. If your see errors or warnings that you Accelerator license is expired or expiring, you must first uninstall all your licenses, and then re-install the <code>Datical DB Admin</code> or <code>Datical DB Deployer</code> license. See&#160;<a href="CLI_Commands.htm">uninstallLicense command</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="CLI_Commands.htm">installLicense command</a>&#160;for details.</p>

        <p>The Datical Accelerator for Oracle improves performance by compressing the results data produced by an Oracle database before sending them to Datical DB. Using the accelerator involves a tradeoff between host resource usage and network usage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires additional CPU and memory resources on the database host (for compressing) and the Datical DB host (for uncompressing).</li>
            <li>Reduces time and network resources for sending the results data over the wire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The accelerator can be helpful in cases where the network connection is slow, such as when lower-speed networks are used or when the Oracle database and Datical DB application are far apart geographically. The performance depends on the results data generated. Generally speaking, performance can be improved by a factor of 10X or more.</p>
        <p>You install the following components to enable the performance improvement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Datical DB Driver for Oracle</li>
            <li>Datical Accelerator, a Java class loaded into the Oracle JavaVM</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the Datical Accelerator is enabled for a project or database, all Datical commands in that context use it.</p>
