        <h1>Auto-rollback of Changes</h1>
        <p>Many change types such as "createTable" and "addColumn" can be automatically rolled back. If a changeset contains only statements that fit into this category, then it can be rolled back automatically.&#160;</p>
        <p>Rollback operations (GUI and CLI) use a rollback script if you have provided one. If a rollback script is not available, the rollback operation checks all of the changes to determine if all of them can be rolled back automatically. If any change in the rollback operation cannot be performed automatically, the rollback operation fails with an error.&#160;</p>
        <p>See <a href="Auto_rollback_Support_by_Database_Object_Change_Type.htm">Auto-rollback Support by Database Object Change Type</a>&#160;for a list of the changes you can roll back automatically.</p>
